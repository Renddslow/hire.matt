				<p>I'm Matt McElwee. I consult with organizations, churches, and small businesses in all areas of digital communication and branding.</p>
				<p>Here's the deal. You have a mission, a calling, or a goal. If you've gotten this far in the 21st century you have most likely experienced the pain of trying to stay current and relevant in all of your digital communications, from websites to social media. In fact, if you are not perfectly wired to handle all the tedious details of responsive design, SEO, social media marketing, digital strategy, and performance optimization, you could already be costing your organization hundreds if not thousands of dollars a day.</p>
				<p>My goal is to get you focused on what you do best. Running your business or organization and ultimately doing what you are called to do.</p>
